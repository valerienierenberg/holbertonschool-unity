- [Project Page](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/534)
## Learning Objectives
- What is rendering
- What is a render pipeline
- What is Unityâ€™s Scriptable Render Pipeline
- What is a shader
- What is ShaderGraph and how is it used
- How to setup a new project that utilizes ShaderGraph
- What is the difference between surface, vertex and fragment shaders
- What is UV mapping
- What is vertex animation
## Task Descriptions
- Glow up (glow.shadergraph) : A material and shader that makes an untextured 3D GameObject glow around the edges.
- Pulse (glow_animated.shadergraph) : Glow pulses / fades in and out.
- Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good (disintegrate.shadergraph) : A shader that simulates a disintegrating or dissolving effect.
- Iceman (ice.shadergraph) : A shader that makes an object look like ice. The object should be partially transparent.
- Hey Cortana, what's UV positioning? (hologram.shadergraph) : A shader that applies a flickering hologram effect to an object. You must use a Texture in this shader.
- Sine of the sea (water.shadergraph) : Animated shader that simulates the appearance of water.
